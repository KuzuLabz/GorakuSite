##### Notes
> <sup id="f1">1</sup> SauceNao rarely gave me correct results so I'm not sure if it's worth implementing [⏎](#a1)  
> <sup id="f2">2</sup> I would like to train my own model but I'm broke. I will likely use the same model (~100MB) as [WaifuTagger](https://github.com/KuzuLabz/WaifuTagger) [⏎](#a2)  
> <sup id="f3">3</sup> Just like with reviews, thread posts uses Anilists custom markdown. This makes it more difficult to implement (not impossible). I'm looking into a more robust solution for this [⏎](#a3)
