##### Notes
> <sup id="f1">1</sup> SauceNao rarely gave me correct results but I'll add it anyways. [⏎](#a1)  
> <sup id="f2">2</sup> Just like with reviews, thread posts uses AniLists custom markdown. This makes it "annoying" to implement. For now, I'm just using basic JS replace and regex to preprocess and [react-native-markdown-display](https://github.com/iamacup/react-native-markdown-display) for rendering. [⏎](#a2)  
> <sup id="f3">3</sup> If I add thread inputs (like commenting / replying) then users will likely expect a similar editing experience to the AniList site. This feature would have to wait till after 1.4 because I have a feeling it'll take me a good while to make. [⏎](#a3)
