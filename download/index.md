::: info
⚠️**Goraku is currently only available on Android**⚠️
:::

You can find all Goraku releases [here](https://github.com/KuzuLabz/GorakuSite/releases)

## Android

Android is fully supported. Goraku currently looks the best on larger phones, but should look okay on most devices.

## iOS

iOS is planned to be supported and is under development.

## Tablets

Tablets aren't officially supported, but Goraku should still be useable. I am currently working on proper UI scaling for tablets.

## Windows / MacOS

Would be cool to support. Once all main features are added, this will be something I'll look into.
